Who says glowing skin has to cost a fortune? With the unfortunate pop-up of adult acne I've been dealing with lately (Why!?), I've been doomscrooling searching for the best and cheapest skincare solutions. Thankfully, since glass skin is so in, there are now tons of affordable options on the market available for anyone to grab at stores like Target. Here, Iâ€™m sharing my personal favorite products that have been keeping my skin smooth, hydrated, and happy without breaking the bank.

## Gentle Cleansers

No frills; Just give me a basic cleanser that is gentle enough for sensitive skin, removes my makeup and, *for the love of god*, doesn't sting my eyes!

- [Prequel Facial Gleanser Cleanser](https://benable.com/barefootandbundled/soft-skin-without-the-splurge/details?detail_id=13561668)
- [Garnier SkinActive Cleansing Micellar Water](https://benable.com/barefootandbundled/soft-skin-without-the-splurge/details?detail_id=12594333)

Centella is great for acne-prone skin, so SKIN1004's Ampoule Foam has been my holy grail for years. Prequel is new to me, but I instantly fell in love after trying the travel size! Finally, makeup is no match for some micellar water and honestly, sometimes a girl just wants to quickly rinse her face and get to bed. The Garnier micellar water has been my go-to since high school.

## Serums & Treatments That Put in the Work

Industry representative, the World Federation of Direct Selling Associations (WFDSA), reports that its 59 regional member associations accounted for more than US$183 billion in retail sales in 2014, through the activities of more than 62 million independent sales representatives. The United States Direct Selling Association (DSA) reported that in 2000, 55% of adult Americans had at some time purchased goods or services from a direct selling representative and 20% reported that they were currently(6%) or had been in the past(14%) a direct selling representative.

According to the WFDSA, consumers benefit from direct selling because of the convenience and service it provides, including personal demonstration and explanation of products, home delivery, and generous satisfaction guarantees. In contrast to franchising, the cost for an individual to start an independent direct selling business is typically very low with little or no required inventory or other cash commitments to begin.

Most direct selling associations around the world require their members to abide by a code of conduct towards a fair partnership both with customers and salesmen...

## Hydrating Moisturizers

Direct selling is distinct from direct marketing because it is about individual sales agents reaching and dealing directly with clients. Direct marketing is about business organizations seeking a relationship with their customers without going through an agent/consultant or retail outlet.

Direct selling consists of two main business models: single-level marketing, in which a direct seller makes money by buying products from a parent organization and selling them directly to customers, and multi-level marketing (also known as network marketing or person-to-person marketing), in which the direct seller makes money from both direct sales to customers and by sponsoring new direct sellers and earning a commission from their efforts.
